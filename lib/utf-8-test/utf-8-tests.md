# UTF-8 Testing

> This test file can help you examine, how your UTF-8 decoder handles

> sequences. This file is not meant to be a conformance test. It does
> not prescribe any particular outcome. Therefore, there is no way to
> "pass" or "fail" this test file, even though the text does suggest a
> preferable decoder behaviour at some places. Its aim is, instead, to
> help you think about, and test, the behaviour of your UTF-8 decoder
> on a systematic collection of unusual inputs. Experience so far
> suggests that most first-time authors of UTF-8 decoders find at
> least one serious problem in their decoder using this file.

Converts normal text into a series of Unicode lookalikes.  Example:

    Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries.
